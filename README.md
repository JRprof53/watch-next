This extensions lets you tell YouTube which video you want to watch next.
Ever saw a couple of YouTube video and wanted to watch them just right after the one you are watching now? Make a Watch Next playlist - it plays automatically when you finish watching the current video.

You can add a video to Watch Next playlist from YouTube related videos (button on the thumbnail), or just from any link to YouTube (right-click menu).

Have fun making playlist!
